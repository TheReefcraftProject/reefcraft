# Reefcraft Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Reefcraft Project! This document outlines our coding standards, development process, and collaboration practices. Whether you're an intern, core team member, or an open-source contributor, this guide will help you understand how we work together.

---

## üåä Project Overview
Reefcraft is a scientific simulation platform that models coral growth and marine ecosystems using physically-based methods. The core logic is in Python with performance-critical components in C++.

We value:
- Scientific accuracy
- Code quality and clarity
- Collaboration and shared ownership

---

## üîÅ Agile Development Process
We work in **1-week iterations**, starting Sunday and ending the following Friday, with planning on Friday before the new iteration.

### Team Roles
- **Sage & Gaeryth** ‚Äì Software development (core code, DevOps)
- **Marcus** ‚Äì Business modeling and research
- **Amy** ‚Äì Business, sales, marketing expert and leadership
- **Justin** ‚Äì Contributor across all domains and team lead

### Weekly Flow
- **Friday** ‚Äì Review current iteration, plan next
- **Sunday** ‚Äì New iteration officially begins
- **Monday** ‚Äì First full workday of new sprint
- Contributors **select their own work** based on interests and team needs

## ‚úÖ User Story & Task Workflow
We use GitHub Issues to track work. Each feature or problem should begin as a **User Story** with small actionable sub-issues.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Standard Prompt for Creating User Stories & Subtasks
> "Write a GitHub-formatted user story and checklist of 1‚Äì4 hour subtasks using the following format. Prefix each subtask with `[Subtask]` for automation. Include any validation or test work as subtasks."

### ‚úÖ Example
```
**User Story**
As a contributor, I want to integrate logging into the simulation loop so that we can debug and analyze coral growth over time.

**Tasks**
- [ ] [Subtask] Create a `logger.py` module with basic logging config
- [ ] [Subtask] Add log events for growth step and voxel updates
- [ ] [Subtask] Write a test that asserts log output is generated
- [ ] [Subtask] Validate logs are visible in console and saved to file
```

## üîß Coding Standards

### Python
- Use `pytest` for unit testing (required)
- Type annotations are encouraged and should be validated manually (no `mypy` enforced yet)
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) (docstrings)
- We use [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for automatic linting and formatting

### C++ (for extensions)
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use PascalCase for types and classes
- Favor `constexpr` and `enum class` where possible
- Follow C++17/20 standards (as determined by CMake)

### Git
- Use descriptive branch names: `feat/<feature>`, `fix/<bug>`, `test/<module>`
- Write clear commit messages
- Squash merge all PRs (see below)

---

## üîÄ Pull Request Process

### Guidelines
- Open a PR as early as possible (even in draft) for visibility
- Include a clear title and description
- Link issues using `Closes #<issue>`
- Keep commits clean and scoped
- Add test coverage where applicable

### Merge Strategy
We use **Squash and Merge** only.
- This ensures a clean, linear history
- The **author is responsible** for merging after approval
- The final commit message should summarize the full change

---

## üîÅ Continuous Integration (CI)
We use **GitHub Actions** for automated testing and linting:

- All pull requests and commits to `main` trigger the CI pipeline
- Tests are run using `pytest`
- Code style and formatting are enforced via `ruff`
- CI must pass before merging any PR

## ü§ñ Using Codex for Development
We support using **Codex via ChatGPT Pro** for feature development and bug fixing.

### Setup Instructions
1. Ensure you have a ChatGPT Pro account
2. Visit [https://chat.openai.com/codex](https://chat.openai.com/codex) to launch Codex
3. During Codex setup, connect it to the [Reefcraft repo](https://github.com/TheReefcraftProject/reefcraft)
4. Enable **default limited internet access** so Codex has a writable container and repo context to enable builds and CI
- Paste a GitHub issue into your Codex prompt when requesting help
- Keep all task context in the issue for transparency and traceability
- Submit work as a pull request (PR) as usual
- Ensure all CI checks pass before merging

## üí° Contributor Tips
- Always link work to issues
- Use Codespaces or pull locally to review full file context
- Ask for review early
- Suggest `RELEASES.md` entries in your PR
